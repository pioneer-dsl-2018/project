# enabling modes
enable draw-mode
enable hand-mode

# in draw-mode, we directly add elements instead of declaring
# theta is the angle above horizontal, zoom makes the element bigger

add switch with d = right zoom = 3
add capacitor with theta = 120 zoom = 3
add line with d = right zoom = 3
add source with d = up zoom = 4
add voltmeter with d = right
