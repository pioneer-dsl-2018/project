# Project plan

## Language evaluation

My primary aim is for this language to be able to deal with the different kinds of trigonometric proofs without need for the user to specify what kind of identities need to be used for the same (e.g. - double-angle identities, compound-angle identities, reciprocal identities, etc.). If the user is able to write as natural a program in this language as they would by hand and the output is relatively similar (comprehensive enough but not exceedingly lengthy) to their own idea of verification for the identity, then this DSL will have accomplished its goals. In order to evaluate my language design and ensure it is fluent and comprehensible enough for domain-experts to utilize efficiently, I aim to consult a set of beginner, intermediate, and expert students in trigonometric proofs and ask them what they would expect such a program to look like and then compare and contrast it with the actual syntax of the DSL. In order to ensure that my language implementation is of high quality, I shall test a variety of different kinds of proofs requiring different kinds of manipulation and evaluate whether or not the expected output is produced.

## Implementation plan

Since I have not previously worked on developing a DSL from scratch or on programming in this particular domain, I am not entirely certain if the schedule below is realistic or whether its estimates are too conservative/lenient in terms of timelines. I was able to find a library which supports simplifying and expanding trigonometric equations using identities in Python (SymPy) hence I believe this may be a suitable choice of host language. For the actual implementation of the language, below is my estimate of the implementation schedule.

In the 1st week, I aim to create a library which contains functions with the ability to simplify a given trigonometric expression using the basic identities as well as compound-angle identities, double-angle identities, and reciprocal identities (with specification as to what kind of identities are to be used). In the 2nd week, I aim to modify and concatenate these functions so that they are able to output the different steps needed to verify a given equation using compound-angle, square, double-angle, and reciprocal trigonometric identities (again, with specification as to what kind of identities are to be used). My primary aim in this week will, however, be to add fluency to this DSL and remove the host flavor as far as is possible to bring it as close to the ideal design as I can. In the 3rd week, I aim to remove the need for the user to specify the kind of identities to be used such that the user can simply input an equation and steps to verify the equality are output; this would also contribute to the fluency of the language in my view. In the 4th week, I aim to eliminate unnecessary steps appearing in the output so that the most concise and comprehensible output is presented as well as to implement error-handling procedures and messages.

## Contingency plan

Since I havenâ€™t worked with this domain in the past in terms of programming, I believe that this is a technically-ambitious project for me hence I may encounter certain obstacles when working on the same. If the obstacles I encounter are technical in terms of the logic required to classify and hence simplify a particular kind of trigonometric expression, I will aim to read up in advance on what steps are advised in order to be able to do so to equip myself with the knowledge required to implement this DSL. In case I encounter any issues with compile-time or run-time errors, I will attempt to solve them using Stack Overflow and by familiarizing myself with Python error-handling procedures and messages.
