# Design notebook entry

## Last week's critique

**TODO:** Fill in this part with a summary and reflection on the critique you
received for last week's work. Answer questions such as:  How, specifically, did
the feedback help improve the project? Did the feedback point out or offer
something you hadn't considered? Did it help you make a design decision? Was it 
helpful in addressing the most pressing issues in your project? How will you
incorporate the feedback into your work? Will you change something about the 
design, implementation, or evaluation as a result?

## Description

**TODO:** Fill in this part with a description of the work you did this week:
tasks you did, important design decisions you made, changes to previous
decisions, questions that you discovered while working, a feature you finished,
etc. Include images (e.g., a sketch of the design or a screenshot of a running
program), links to code in your GitHub repo, and any other resources that you
think will help clearly convey your design process.

## Questions for you to answer

**What is the most important issue for your project? For example, what design decision do
you need to make, or what implementation issue are you trying to solve?**

**What questions do you have for your critique partner? What feedback can they
give you that would help you the most?**

**How much time did you spend on the project this week?**
