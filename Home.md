If you'd like your project to be stand-alone and exist outside of this class, you would perhaps make this page be the homepage for your documentation.

For now, head over to the [[instructions page|Instructions]] for information on how to use this wiki to record your project milestones.

You can also use the sidebar on the right to navigate to the notebook entries and milestone documents.
