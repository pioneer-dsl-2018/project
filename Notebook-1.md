# Design notebook entry

## Description

**TODO:** Fill in this part with a description of the work you did this week:
tasks you did, important design decisions you made, changes to previous
decisions, questions that you discovered while working, a feature you finished,
etc. Include images (e.g., a sketch of the design or a screenshot of a running
program), links to code in your GitHub repo, and any other resources that you
think will help clearly convey your design process.

## Questions for you to answer

**What is the most important issue for your project? For example, what design decision do
you need to make, or what implementation issue are you trying to solve?**

**What questions do you have for your critique partner? What feedback can they
give you that would help you the most?**

**How much time did you spend on the project this week?**
